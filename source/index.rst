Welcome to the TwinLife documentation!
================================================

TwinLife is a 12-year representative behavior genetic study investigating the development of social inequality.

The long-term project has begun in 2014 and surveys more than 4,000 pairs of twins and their families regarding 
their different stages of life on a yearly basis. Not only social, but also genetic mechanisms as well as covariations 
and interactions between these two parameters can be examined with the help of identical and fraternal twins.

In order to document the individual development of different parameters it is important to examine a family extensively 
over the course of several years. Six important contextual points are focused on: Education and academic performance, career 
and labor market attainment, integration and participation in social, cultural and political life, quality of life and perceived 
capabilities, physical and psychological health and eventually behavioral issues and deviant behavior. The so collected data can 
give insight into questions concerning the development of social inequalities and will be made available to the scientific community.
